## Working with Dates and Time

In PowerShell, working with dates and times is a common task, and the `Get-Date` cmdlet is your trusty companion for this. It returns a `DateTime` object, which is much more than just a simple string or number.

lets compare this with the date command in cmd. what is the difference?
cmd date
and powershell get-date

```powershell
$today = Get-Date

# Display the full DateTime object
$today
# Access specific properties
$today.Year
$today.Month
$today.Day
$today.Hour
```

### Exploring Get-Date with Get-Member

The `Get-Member` cmdlet is a powerful tool for discovering the properties and methods of objects in PowerShell. We can use it to explore the `DateTime` object returned by `Get-Date`:

```powershell
Get-Date | Get-Member
```

```powershell
Get-Date | Get-Member -MemberType Property
Get-Date | Get-Member -MemberType Method
```


This command will display all the properties and methods available on the `DateTime` object. Some key properties include:

- `Date`: Gets the date component of the `DateTime` object.
- `DayOfWeek`: Gets the day of the week represented by this `DateTime` instance.
- `DayOfYear`: Gets the day of the year represented by this `DateTime` instance.
- `TimeOfDay`: Gets the time of day for this instance.

You can also use `Get-Member` to explore specific property types:

```powershell
Get-Date | Get-Member -MemberType Property
Get-Date | Get-Member -MemberType Method
```

These commands will show you only the properties or methods of the `DateTime` object, respectively.

### Formatting Dates

[Microsoft Format Datetime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/orchestrator/standard-activities/format-date-time?view=sc-orch-2022)

```powershell
Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd" # Outputs: 2023-04-15
Get-Date -Format "dddd, MMMM dd, yyyy" # Outputs: Saturday, April 15, 2023
Get-Date -Format "HH:mm:ss" # Outputs: 14:30:45
```

### Date Arithmetic

```powershell
$tomorrow = (Get-Date).AddDays(1)
$lastWeek = (Get-Date).AddDays(-7)
$twoHoursLater = (Get-Date).AddHours(2)
```

### Exercise: Calculate Your Age in Days and Hours

Here's a complete solution to the exercise, including the bonus challenges:

```powershell

$myBirthInfo = @{
    Year = "1982"
    Month = "5"
    Day = "7"
}

$myBirthDate = Get-Date -Year $myBirthInfo.Year -Month $myBirthInfo.Month -Day $myBirthInfo.Day

# Step 3: Calculate days alive
$daysAlive = (Get-Date) - $myBirthDate
$daysAlive.TotalDays

# Step 4: Calculate hours alive
$totalHours = [math]::Round($daysAlive.TotalHours)

# Bonus 1: Calculate weeks alive
$totalWeeks = $daysAlive.TotalDays / 7




```
