PowerShell is an object-oriented scripting language. It represents data and system states using structured objects derived from .NET classes defined in the .NET Framework. By leveraging the .NET Framework, PowerShell offers access to various system capabilities, including file system, registry, and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes. PowerShell also has access to the .NET Framework class library, which contains a vast collection of classes that you can use to develop robust PowerShell scripts.

In PowerShell, each item or state is an instance of an object that can be explored and manipulated. The Get-Member cmdlet is one of the primary tools provided by PowerShell for object discovery, which reveals an object's characteristics. This chapter explores how PowerShell leverages objects and how you can discover and manipulate these objects to streamline your scripts and manage your systems more efficiently.
