## The 80/20 Rule
The Pareto Principle states that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. 
In our PowerShell training we want to focus on the 20%  that will bring you the most value.

The Pareto Principle, named after economist Vilfredo Pareto, was first formulated when he observed economic patterns in society. While originally developed in an economic context, this principle has since been found to occur naturally across many different aspects of life.

This distribution pattern has since been observed across numerous fields:
- **Business**: 20% of customers generate 80% of revenue
- **Software**: 80% of users only use 20% of features
- **Productivity**: 20% of our efforts produce 80% of our results

These patterns consistently demonstrate how a vital **few inputs drive the majority of outputs**, making the principle invaluable for prioritization and resource allocation.

- 80% of the automation tasks are created with the 20% of the most used cmdlets
- Learning these core fundamentals with  (like `Get-Command`, `Get-Help`, `Get-Member`)
- Understanding the Pipeline and the Object-Orientation of PowerShell
- Encouraging to start small and build step by step


## A Colleague's Perspective

I'm not approaching this as a traditional teacher but as your colleague from UMB.

My goal is to share practical, real-world experience as i have been working with PowerShell for over 10 years and also within UMB a similar number of years.


## Project-Based Learning

This training isn't just about learning a list of commands and syntax.

Lets try to get something useful. 
We'll work towards creating a practical project that you can:

- Implement in your Team or your daily work.
- Customize for your specific needs
- Use as a foundation for future automation


## Coaching

Recognizing that our two-day course cannot cover every aspect of PowerShell, We can do a follow-up to create a continuous learning environment to help you build on the foundational skills acquired during the course and develop advanced capabilities over time that can help you and your team.

## Orgainzation 

we will do a 5-10 min break every 1-1.5 hours.
lunch break will be at 11.30 - 12.30.
Course will finish at arround 17.00
