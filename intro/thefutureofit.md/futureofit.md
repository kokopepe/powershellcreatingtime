## Is AI Better Than at Scripting?

The answer is simply: <span style="color: red; font-size: 24px;">**Yes**</span>. 
And not just in one area, but across multiple domains but here we will focus on coding.


## Advanced Capabilities in Programming

- it is a "closed domain" with well-defined rules. AI can effectively learn and apply these rules.
- Matches top-tier Codeforces competitors.- Often surpasses human solutions on LeetCode.Achieves ~50% resolution on SWE-Benchmark (Real life GitHub requests)
- Delivers clear, concise documentation

## 🏗️ T-Shaped Skills: The Modern Advantage

  - 🔎 <b>Deep Expertise:</b> Become an expert in at least one domain—be it a programming language, platform, product, methodology, or even a soft skill. Be authoritative in your specialty.<br>
  - 🌐 <b>Broad Knowledge:</b> Build general knowledge across multiple areas (e.g., Python, API, ServiceNow, PowerShell, AWS, Azure, SQL). Understand business processes and workflows within your organization.</br>
  - 🤖 <b>Leverage AI to Connect the Dots:</b> Use AI to combine your broad skills and technologies, creating innovative solutions that add value. <br>
  - 💡 <b>Soft Skills Matter:</b> Creative problem-solving, cross-functional collaboration, and strategic thinking become even more valuable. Use your contextual knowledge and AI tools together to maximize your impact.</br>

##  The Rise of IT Agents

-  <b>Autonomous Operations:</b> AI agents are becoming increasingly capable of managing IT infrastructure, monitoring systems, and responding to incidents without human intervention.<br>

### IT Agent Capabilities

- 🔌 <b>System Connections:</b> Agents can connect to and interact with:
  - Cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP)
  - On-premises servers and infrastructure
  - Network devices and security systems
  - Monitoring and logging systems
  - Ticketing and workflow systems
  - Communication platforms (Teams, Slack, Email)

- ⚡ <b>Action Capabilities:</b> These agents can:
  - Automatically scale resources up or down
  - Deploy security patches and updates
  - Restart failed services
  - Reconfigure network settings
  - Create and update documentation
  - Generate and send reports
  - Open and update support tickets
  - Alert teams with detailed analysis

<div style="flex: 1; background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 10px; padding: 24px;">
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">🛠️ The Generalist</h2>
  <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
    <li>🌐 <b>Broad Knowledge:</b> Comfortable with many tools, technologies, and domains.</li>
    <li>🔄 <b>Adaptable:</b> Can quickly switch between tasks and learn new skills.</li>
    <li>🤝 <b>Connector:</b> Bridges gaps between teams and disciplines.</li>
    <li>🚀 <b>Great for Startups & Small Teams:</b> Wears many hats and drives innovation.</li>
  </ul>

<div style="flex: 1; background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 10px; padding: 24px;">
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">🔬 The Specialist</h2>
  <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
    <li>🎯 <b>Deep Expertise:</b> Master of a specific field or technology.</li>
    <li>🛡️ <b>Problem Solver:</b> Handles complex, high-stakes challenges in their area.</li>
    <li>🏆 <b>High Demand:</b> Essential for critical projects and advanced troubleshooting.</li>
    <li>📈 <b>Career Growth:</b> Often leads to expert or leadership roles in their niche.</li>
  </ul>

## Shift towards Genralist?

- Technical remain important but there is a new paradigm where the generalist gains value over the specialsit

- Develop a broad technical general and business knowledge—and leverage AI alongside soft skills to drive innovative and cross-functional solutions.

- Becoming the go to person to deliver solutions



## 💥 The 10x Engineer

- 🚀 <b>What is a 10x Engineer?</b> A "10x engineer" is someone whose impact, productivity, or output is considered to be 10 times greater than that of an average engineer.

- 🌟 <b>Despite what I wrote about the generalist and the specialist </b> There is also a possibility of emerging new role. It is the already "leading expert" who is capable of leverage 10x factor with IA.  
It can replace multiple less senior and junior roles within the organization which are not adjusting to new reality. It can




## 🤔 in AI is time for the Generalist or for the Specialist?

- Develop a broad technical general and business knowledge—and leverage AI alongside soft skills to drive innovative and cross-functional solutions. Becoming the go to person to deliver solutions. (Generalist in times of AI)
- But there is also the possibility to go down the path of leveraging the impact IA for an  specialist and maximize it becoming a 10x engineer (Specialist in times of AI)

- Certain roles focus on the hard code skills will face more disruption.

##  Human Advantage: Soft Skills

- 🎨 <b>Creative & Contextual Insight:</b> Humans excel at thinking outside the box and understanding context that AI may miss.<br>
- 🤝 <b>Collaborative Innovation:</b> Building relationships, mentoring, and driving synergy within teams.<br>
- ⚖️ <b>Ethical & Moral Judgment:</b> Complex decisions often require human values, empathy, and responsibility.<br>
- 🧭 <b>Strategic Oversight:</b> Human teams set vision, ensure quality, and address unforeseen challenges.<br>


## 🏗️ T-Shaped Skills: The Modern Advantage

## 🤖 The Rise of IT Agents

- 🎯 <b>Autonomous Operations:</b> AI agents are becoming increasingly capable of managing IT infrastructure, monitoring systems, and responding to incidents without human intervention.<br>
- 🔄 <b>Continuous Learning:</b> These agents improve over time, learning from system patterns and incident responses to become more efficient and proactive.<br>
- 🤝 <b>Human-Agent Collaboration:</b> The future of IT operations will be a partnership between human experts and AI agents, where humans focus on strategy and complex problem-solving while agents handle routine tasks and initial incident response.<br>
- 🛡️ <b>Enhanced Security:</b> AI agents can provide 24/7 security monitoring, threat detection, and automated response to security incidents, significantly reducing response times.<br>

## 🚨 Call to Action: 

- Embrace the power of AI and leverage it to create innovative solutions that add value to your organization.
- Scripting is like Glue: PowerShell connects systems, automates workflows ...
- AI + PowerShell = Force Multiplier: Use AI to generate, optimize, and troubleshoot scripts—turning routine tasks into automated power plays.
- Don't Just Copy, Understand: Let AI accelerate learning, but develop intuition behind the scripts. Mastery comes when you know why something works.
