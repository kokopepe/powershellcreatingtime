# The Future of IT in the Age of AI


<p align="## Disadvnatages of AI.

- Hallucinations (false facts)
AI can confidently invent information, references, or data that look credible but are simply wrong.

- Overly agreeable ("flattering")
AI tends to sound confident and positive, even when it might be wrong, which can create a false sense of certainty.

- Prompt spiral frustration
It's easy to get stuck rephrasing the same request repeatedly without reaching the desired outcome — leading to wasted time and irritation.

- Highly dependent on prompting
Without clear, well-structured prompts, outputs can be vague, misleading, or off-track.

## Is AI Better Than at Scripting?

The answer is simply: <span style="color: red; font-size: 24px;">**Yes**</span>. 
And not just in one area, but across multiple domains but here we will focus on coding.


## Advanced Capabilities in Programming

- it is a "closed domain" with well-defined rules. AI can effectively learn and apply these rules.
- Matches top-tier Codeforces competitors.- Often surpasses human solutions on LeetCode.Achieves ~50% resolution on SWE-Benchmark (Real life GitHub requests)
- Delivers clear, concise documentation


##  The Rise of IT Agents

-  <b>Autonomous Operations:</b> AI agents are becoming increasingly capable of managing IT infrastructure, monitoring systems, and responding to incidents without human intervention.<br>


##  Human Advantage:

    80% is the human side. understanding, sense-making, planning<br>
    20% is writing the code / implementing the solution

- You talk with users to understand their challenges 
- You distill these discussion and ideate concrete goals 
- You plan ways to to build those goals 
- You share those plans with colleagues 
- You translate those plans into code/Actions 
- You test and verify that the result matches your plans and achieves your original goals

- 🎨 <b>Creative & Contextual Insight:</b> Thinking outside the box and understanding context <br>
- 🤝 <b>Collaborative Innovation:</b> Building relationships to lead to positive outcomes<br>
- ⚖️ <b>Ethical & Moral Judgment:</b> Complex decisions often require human values, empathy, and responsibility.<br>
- 🧭 <b>Strategic Oversight:</b> Human teams set vision, ensure quality, and address unforeseen challenges.<br>

<div style="flex: 1; background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 10px; padding: 24px;">
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">🛠️ The Generalist</h2>
  <ul style="font-size: 18px;">
    <li>🌐 <b>Broad Knowledge:</b> Comfortable with many tools, technologies, and domains.</li>
    <li>🔄 <b>Adaptable:</b> Can quickly switch between tasks and learn new skills.</li>
    <li>🤝 <b>Connector:</b> Bridges gaps between teams and disciplines.</li>
    <li>🚀 <b>Great for Startups & Small Teams:</b> Wears many hats and drives innovation.</li>
  </ul>

## Shift towards Genralist?

- Technical remain important but there is a new paradigm where the generalist gains value over the specialsit

- Develop a broad technical general and business knowledge—and leverage AI alongside soft skills to drive innovative and cross-functional solutions.

- Becoming the go to person to deliver solutions



## 🤔 in AI is time for the Generalist or for the Specialist?

- Develop a broad technical general and business knowledge—and leverage AI alongside soft skills to drive innovative and cross-functional solutions. Becoming the go to person to deliver solutions. (Generalist in times of AI)
- But there is also the possibility to go down the path of leveraging the impact IA for an  specialist and maximize it becoming a 10x engineer (Specialist in times of AI)

- Certain roles focus on the hard code skills will face more disruption.

<br>






## 🏗️ T-Shaped Skills: The Modern Advantage

  - 🔎 <b>Deep Expertise:</b> Become an expert in at least one domain—be it a programming language, platform, product, methodology, or even a soft skill. Be authoritative in your specialty.<br>
  - 🌐 <b>Broad Knowledge:</b> Build general knowledge across multiple areas (e.g., Python, API, ServiceNow, PowerShell, AWS, Azure, SQL). Understand business processes and workflows within your organization.</br>
  - 🤖 <b>Leverage AI to Connect the Dots:</b> Use AI to combine your broad skills and technologies, creating innovative solutions that add value. <br>
  - 💡 <b>Soft Skills Matter:</b> Creative problem-solving, cross-functional collaboration, and strategic thinking become even more valuable. Use your contextual knowledge and AI tools together to maximize your impact.</br>


## 💥 The 10x Engineer

- 🚀 <b>What is a 10x Engineer?</b> A "10x engineer" is someone whose impact, productivity, or output is considered to be 10 times greater than that of an average engineer.

- 🌟 <b>Despite what I wrote about the generalist and the specialist </b> There is also a possibility of emerging new role. It is the already "leading expert" who is capable of leverage 10x factor with IA.  
It can replace multiple less senior and junior roles within the organization which are not adjusting to new reality. 


## 🚨 Call to Action: 

- Embrace the power of AI and leverage it to create innovative solutions that add value to your organization.
- Scripting is like Glue: PowerShell connects systems, automates workflows ...
- AI + PowerShell = Force Multiplier: Use AI to generate, optimize, and troubleshoot scripts—turning routine tasks into automated power plays.
- Don't Just Copy, Understand: Let AI accelerate learning, but develop intuition behind the scripts. Mastery comes when you know why something works.
