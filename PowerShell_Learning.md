# PowerShell: A Powerful Shell and Scripting Language

PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation solution made up of a command-line shell and a scripting language. PowerShell runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

It allows administrators and developers to automate repetitive tasks, manage system configurations, and perform complex administrative actions across different operating systems.

With its object-oriented nature, it enables users to manipulate data objects directly, making it a powerful tool for both IT professionals and developers.

## 1. PowerShell as a Shell

PowerShell provides an interactive command-line interface (CLI) for system management:

- **Interactive Command Execution**: Run commands to navigate the file system, manage files, and control system services with immediate execution and display of results.
- **Comprehensive Administrative Control**: 
  - Manage Windows operating systems
  - Administer SQL Server databases
  - Active Directory management
  - Cloud platforms (Azure, AWS)
  - Office 365 tasks
- **Object-Oriented Approach**: Unlike traditional text-based shells, PowerShell works with structured data objects.
- **Built-in Cmdlets**: Numerous pre-built commands for various management tasks across different platforms.

### üîç Key Shell Concepts

1. **Cmdlets (Command-lets)**
   - Verb-Noun naming convention (e.g., `Get-Process`, `Set-Location`)
   - Consistent parameter naming
   - Built-in help system

2. **Aliases**
   - Short names for common commands
   - Example: `ls` is an alias for `Get-ChildItem`
   - Use `Get-Alias` to discover available aliases

3. **Providers**
   - Access different data stores as if they were file systems
   - Examples: FileSystem, Registry, Certificate Store

## 2. PowerShell as a Scripting Language

PowerShell stands out because it is:
- **OBJECT-ORIENTED**: Work directly with structured data objects rather than raw text
- **PIPELINE-DRIVEN**: Chain commands together to create powerful automation workflows

### üéØ Core Language Features

1. **Variables and Data Types**
   - Strong typing with type inference
   - Common types: String, Int, DateTime, Array, Hashtable
   - Custom objects and classes

2. **Control Flow**
   - If/Else statements
   - Switch statements
   - Loops (For, While, Do-While, ForEach)
   - Try/Catch for error handling

3. **Functions and Modules**
   - Reusable code blocks
   - Parameter validation
   - Module organization
   - Script modules vs. binary modules

## 3. Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Shell Navigation
```powershell
# Task: Navigate through your system and gather information
# 1. List all processes running on your system
Get-Process

# 2. Find processes using more than 100MB of memory
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.WorkingSet -gt 100MB }

# 3. Export the results to a CSV file
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.WorkingSet -gt 100MB } | Export-Csv -Path "large_processes.csv"
```

### Exercise 2: Working with Files
```powershell
# Task: Create a script that organizes files by extension
# 1. Create a directory structure
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path ".\Documents", ".\Images", ".\Scripts"

# 2. Move files to appropriate directories
Get-ChildItem -File | ForEach-Object {
    switch ($_.Extension) {
        ".txt", ".doc", ".docx" { Move-Item $_.FullName -Destination ".\Documents" }
        ".jpg", ".png", ".gif" { Move-Item $_.FullName -Destination ".\Images" }
        ".ps1", ".bat", ".cmd" { Move-Item $_.FullName -Destination ".\Scripts" }
    }
}
```

### Exercise 3: System Information Gathering
```powershell
# Task: Create a system inventory script
# 1. Gather system information
$systemInfo = @{
    ComputerName = $env:COMPUTERNAME
    OSVersion = (Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem).Version
    Processor = (Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor).Name
    Memory = (Get-CimInstance Win32_PhysicalMemory | Measure-Object -Property Capacity -Sum).Sum / 1GB
    DiskSpace = Get-CimInstance Win32_LogicalDisk | Where-Object { $_.DriveType -eq 3 } | 
                Select-Object DeviceID, @{Name="FreeSpaceGB";Expression={$_.FreeSpace/1GB}}
}

# 2. Export to JSON
$systemInfo | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File "system_inventory.json"
```

## 4. Best Practices
